# Introduction

This is a crash course for someone who wants to learn hands-on skill about cortex-m CPU.   
All examples will be demonstrated in a simplest way with minimized code snippers. To ease the course, I split the program to several days (about a month). one can schedule their learning progress. you don't need to know any computer algorithms or other high-end skills. Just  Have fun and enjoy it.





Environment setups:

- a ubuntu destop
-  your mcu boards(optional)
-  jlink(optional)



Toolchain:

arm-none-eabi-gcc



| Schedule | Topics                      | Num of lines/instructions |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| day0     | compiler tools and settings | 0                         |
| day1     |                             | 12                        |
|          |                             |                           |



TODO:

day0: compiler tools and settings

day1:  the example  shows how to launch a Cortex-M series CPU in less than 10 instructions.

day2: vector table

day3: .bss and .data 

day2: before main , what is the most important things before running application?

day3: run your first apps

day4: calculate 

day5:  Hello world!
