# Introduction

For more information and examples, please refer to the [book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-28701-5) *Embedded and Real-Time Operating Systems* by K. C. Wang. Some examples are partially forked from this [source](https://eecs.wsu.edu/~cs460/ARMhome/). 

I tried to do some labs on NUC980 boards .  NUC980  is powered by an arm926 CPU with max 300MHz clocks. I think the NUC980 is one of the best CPU to validate all the experiments in the book. NUC980 is release by Nuvoton. It is recommended to buy a dev board from the official [website](https://www.nuvoton.com/products/microprocessors/arm9-mpus/nuc980-industrial-control-iot-series/).

Please feel free to make issue if you have any idea!
